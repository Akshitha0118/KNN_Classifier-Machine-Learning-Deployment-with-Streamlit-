# KNN_Classifier-Machine-Learning-Deployment-with-Streamlit-

# 📊 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Dashboard

This project is an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** that demonstrates **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification** with real-time predictions, performance evaluation, and visualizations.

Users can upload a CSV dataset, and the app performs **scaling, prediction, evaluation, ROC analysis, and decision boundary visualization** using a pre-trained KNN model.
